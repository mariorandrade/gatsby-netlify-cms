#### *"Mindfulness means being awake. It means knowing what you are doing.” – Jon Kabat-Zinn*

Naturzen Wellness is about finding simplicity, mindfulness and balance in our daily lives. 

It's a place to help you learn how to clear the clutter and focus on what truly matters to help you find happiness and make you proud of your achievements. 

I have no formal qualifications. I am not an expert, or a doctor, or a coach. I haven’t made millions of dollars and I’m not the world’s greatest athlete.

I have lived and had dreams come true. I also failed a lot and lost almost everything I accomplished during my life. It has been a roller coaster of a life and along the way, I have learned a lot.

I am a regular guy, that wants to share my personal experience to help you achieve more.
