What do you want to achieve in life? 

I'm not a mind reader but I would guess you just thought to yourself where you want to be rather than the journey you need to take to get there.

In fact, most of us, when questioned about this we answer something along the line of having a wonderful family with kids and, a successful business, a nice house, nice car, nice clothes and being able to provide for the family.

These are all destinations but what about the journey? What does it take to get there?

From personal experience I can assure you life has curious ways of showing us the path we need to take and that the actions we take define the destination. 

Tony Robbins is a strong defender that [life happens to us, not for us](https://www.tonyrobbins.com/mind-meaning/life-is-happening-for-me/). By this Tony means that **life will take you where you need to be and eventually where you want to go**, but to get there also means life will, sometimes, move you in different directions of where you want to be.

When this happens you should **embrace the journey** and accept that you are not at a favorable place and that you need to do something to get to where you want to be. 

Understand that **difficult times are a challenge put in your way so you can learn** to deal with it and improve. The journey is there for you to take, the destination will be decided by the actions you take to face the challenge.

So the next time someone asks you what do you want in life instead of saying you want the destination, consider embracing the journey.

"I want a life that teaches me to be better, stronger and wiser so me and my family can learn, evolve prosper together."
