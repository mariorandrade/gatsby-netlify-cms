  Dreams keep us moving forward. They are essential to keep us living and not
  simply existing. They have the ability to take us to places we have never been
  and do things we have never done. They are one of the foundations for a happy
  life.

A while ago when I was browsing Instagram I saw an image that said for a person to be truly happy only needs 3 things:

* Someone to love
* Something to do
* Something to hope for

I found it curious because I see that when people go though really challenging times one of the first things they do and are advised to do is to have something to fill their minds. So having something to do is crucial to move towards an happier life. 

But it's not enough. You need to keep an hungry mind. Having an action-oriented mindset will help you break down the challenges life throws at you and will help you achieve and complete things with a greater sense of accomplishment. For that, you need to have something to be hopeful for and not simply something you would like to.\
\
If there's a goal you currently want to achieve, now is the time to take action.\
\
Write down your ideal outcome. Don't think about how hard it might be or how long it will take, simply write down your ideal final outcome.\
Let's say your dream it to break all of Cristiano Ronaldo records, just write that down "I want to break all Cristiano Ronaldo records".\
\
Now break that challenge into smaller challenges that you can accomplish faster and easier.\
Using the Cristiano Ronaldo example, you can start breaking it down to the simplest of goals like "Become a professional football player".\
\
If that is something you believe it will still take some time to achieve reduce the challenge to something simpler that you can achieve faster.\
\
"Become a football player on a team".\
\
If this also seems that it's going to take a while to achieve, reduce it to a smaller challenge.\
\
"Train to improve my football skills"\
\
Decompose your dream into smaller tasks that you can achieve quickly.

If you can do something everyday that will eventually get  you closer to your dream, just go for it and do it. Don't overthink. Stop thinking about what other people might think or say.\
\
This approach of decomposing the final outcome into smaller goals and setting my mindset to be action focused helped me build my trust back up when I was in a very dark place. 

You will not realize your evolution but if you committed yourself and you kept consistent in working to achieve your goals when you look back and compare where you are to where you started, the evolution should be proof that you are on the right track.\
\
Having something to hope for opened a new perspective in my life. I found a direction to take and that's what I've been building since.\
\
So don't be afraid to dream and most of all don't be afraid to chase your dreams.
