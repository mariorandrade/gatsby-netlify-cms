One of the first questions my coach asked me was if I knew who I was and I thought I did. So he asked me to talk to my friends and figure out the person I was to them. 

##### *If someone asked you who I was, what would you answer?*

The answers where surprising to me how vague they were and I felt a bit down. 

It became clear I needed to take some time off to think to yourself about where I was and where I want to be.

I needed to decide on a direction to take and lead my life on that direction. Life has taught that the first path might not be the direction I want to go in the future but it's the one I am taking right now and honestly, I am thrilled about what it can bring me.

After deciding on the direction to take I realized it was time to to step back, reevaluate where I am currently and understand where the people around me fit in all this. It was hard because it meant things had to change considerably in my personal life but I understood I had to step away from some people that will add much to take me where I want to go. I took the decision to allow other people to come into the space where some of my oldest and closest friends were. I needed to open that space for other people to enter my life.

Along the road I do check-ups on myself:

* Am I going in the direction you want?
* Am I avoiding or running away from something at this point? 
* Am I in full control of my emotions and the direction my life is taking?

To find some answer I needed to have the time, space and clarity to truly reach in so I took a few days and went to a place where I could be completely alone with myself. I removed all the clutter and distractions around me. I was completely available to connect to myself, bring out all the emotions and find the answers I needed to find.

I started by writing down what I wanted to achieve in the next 4 months and started the thought process from there. It was an emotion but amazing experience. I was sad to realize I needed to step away from a couple of people who have been important in my life in the past but to be fully committed to me I had to. Once I accepted that I honestly felt excited about what the future could bring to me.

Today my path for the next 4 months is clear. I know what I want to achieve and I have some understanding about what it takes to get there.

I'm sure I am not prepared for the result right now but I am confident that I will be when the moment comes because I can visualize myself achieving it.

The next 4 months I know my old friends will miss me, but I need new people to come in to my life, people more connected to what I want to achieve. I want to let my old and dear friends be in my life but in a place where they can enjoy my company but not impact my life.

This might seem harsh to some but by doing this I am putting myself in control of the direction I want my life to take and not simply drifting along the way..

One year from now it's possible some people will no longer keep in touch, my old friends will not know how to describe me but the new people I opened space to enter my life will know perfectly who I am and what I have achieve.
