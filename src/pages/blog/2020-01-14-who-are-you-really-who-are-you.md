One of the first questions my coach asked me was if I knew who I was and I thought I did. So he gave me an assignment. Ask my friends who I was to them. They didn't understand the question so I shaped it a little and asked If someone asked them who I was, what would they answer.

Their answer surprised me on how vague they were and I felt I needed to act and elevate myself to an upper level.

I needed to decide on what direction to take. I am aware it might not be the direction I want to go in the future but it's the one I am taking right now and I am thrilled about what I can achieve with it.

After deciding on what direction to take I realized I needed to step back, think about the direction I am taking and truly understand where the people around me fit in all this. I understood I had to step away from some people that will not do much to take me where I want to go. I chose to allow that space to be opened for other people to enter my life.

Along the road, you need to check up on yourself. Are you going in the direction you want? Are you running away from something? Are you in control of you and your life?

To have the time, space and clarity to reach in, I took a few days and went to a place where I could be alone with myself. I removed all the clutter and distractions around me. By doing this all the time I had available was to myself.

During this time I wrote down what I wanted to achieve in the next 4 months. It was an amazing experience. I was honestly excited about the future for the first time in a long time.

At this moment my path for the next 4 months is clear. I know what I want to achieve and I have a bit of understanding about what I need to do to get there.

I'm pretty sure I am not prepared for the result right now but I am confident that I will be when the moment comes because I can visualize myself achieving it.

The next 4 months I know my old friends will miss me, but I need new people to come into my life, people more connected to what I want to achieve. I need to let my old and dear friends be in my life but in a place where they can enjoy my company but not impact my life.

This might seem harsh but by doing this I am putting myself in control of the direction I want my life to take and not simply letting life take me somewhere.

One year from now it's possible my old friends will not know how to describe me but the new people I opened space for them to enter my life will know perfectly who I am and what I have achieved.
