**You have a choice** to live a life worth telling or a life people will not remember.

You can create amazing experiences, explore the world, inspire others, make the world a better place by sharing and helping others.

Unfortunately, many are locked to a life that will not be remembered much. Many are hostages of crappy TV created to take time and share empty content.

Young adults are constantly distracted, constantly checking social media, forgetting to connect to the ones that are around them and forgetting to connect with the environment around them. They feel unmotivated and yet keep doing nothing with their time.

Make a choice. Decide how you want your life to be remembered. Decide how you live your days, because you don’t have many of them.

**Each day is limited**. Let’s not waste them anymore.\
\
Live each day, **appreciate each moment** and fall in love with your life.
