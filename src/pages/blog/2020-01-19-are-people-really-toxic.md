  As a part of my weekend retreat to be alone with myself I ended up having
  several talks to myself. I'm not crazy, I swear.


  One of those conversations I had while exploring nature was about toxic
  people.

During my coaching, one of the exercises I had to do was to identify people that could be toxic to me. People that were not helping me to grow and have the life I want to have or feel that I deserve.

And a question kept popping on my mind. In the past, I had people who made me so happy, gave me so much joy, pleasure, and fulfillment but decided to take different paths and part ways. That single decision hurt me deeply, but does that make them toxic people to me?

Choosing to take a different path, even if it hurts other people, as long as it is a path you are sure it is the one you need to take, you should go for it. Wanting to change your life situation for better should never be toxic.

Throughout your life you will make decisions that benefit you but hurt others, you will also make decisions that hurt you but benefit others. Any of these situations can be toxic, or not. The full context will determine that, less than the full context we should not judge the decision.

If you have someone in your life that consistently prevents you from growing and following the life you want to live, even if it is a person you are in love with, you need to part ways.

Parting ways doesn't necessarily mean you will never see each other again, but it does mean you need to stop letting that person have so much influence in your life because you are not living the life you feel you should be living due to that influence.

This also doesn't mean that a person is toxic. It means their attitude and decisions make them a negative influence in your life. The other person might even be an amazing person to others but to you, that person is not a positive influence.

In my particular case, I see them as not being toxic, the moved away and I stepped back to access my life. I decided to remove the people that caused damage but decided to keep the ones I feel that, even though they hurt me with their decisions, I still believe they have so much positive energy to give me. They are not toxic, their decisions while they had so much influence in my life was.
