  We tend to get busy so we don't have to think or deal with the pain of more
  emotionally demanding times but it comes a time when you must answer a simple
  question. Are you ok with being only with yourself?

.

Life was pretty sweet. Everything was in place, my work, my personal life, my achievements were all going great but a few months ago everything came crumbling down...\
\
My relationship ended and with it the life I wanted to live, my dreams of building a family with that person ending.\
\
Everybody deals with situations differently. I have a strong character. My friends, my ex who knows me better than anyone or anybody around me didn't accept or believed I was on a mentally unstable place.\
I have friends who know me for more than 10 years. Saw me go through many complicated times, from break-ups, illness, family issues, and other situations than can off-balance anyone's life. I was the person that never accepted defeat and was always working on building a solution for problems.\
\
But for some reason, I felt completely defeated. I felt I had failed, miserably. I know I shouldn't think like this, but this is such a strong feeling that I couldn't simply positive think my way out of it.\
\
The consequences were terrible. I was unable to sleep, sleeping around 2 to 3 hours per day for weeks, I wasn't hungry and ate only the bare minimum. I went from 82 kg (about 180 pounds) to 67 kg (about 147 pounds) in about 45 days.\
At my job, I was unable to focus on work. I was used to calling or texting my ex every morning around the same time, talk to her throughout the day and I would return to our home at night to be with her.\
And from one night this all ended. This abrupt ending shifted my life balance.\
\
I no longer had a family to build, no longer was going home to the person I love and in a few days I would not have a home to go to at all.\
\
This all happend so fast and it's effects were real challenging to me.\
\
You might think it's ok, it's only temporary but... I'm 36 and I had invested all my time and money for the past 5 years in building my relationship and my ex's self esteem to get her the confidence she has been showing for the past couple of months.\
We moved to one of her parents home to save money on rent. I moved away from my rental and my friends to live with her in a place where she felt confident and had known for all her life.\
\
After the break up I no longer had a home to live, money to rent an apartment closer than 2 hours to my work. I was left with car with a rental to pay every month, my cat some appliances and my clothes... I literally lost everything I built for the past 10 years.\
\
I was devastated that I had put so much effort in to building something that in the end I didn't have much of a choice rather than being forced to accept our relationship was over.\
\
Eventually I had to find help going to doctors and taking medication to be able to sleep and work. At first I though the pills only had placebo effect so I stopped taking them. Big mistake.\
My condition got worse. The doctor advice me to go the a psychologist and the psychologist referred me to a psychiatrist. It took about 1 month until I was able to focus on work and sleep more than 4 hours per day.\
\
I am still dealing with this at the moment I am writing this article and it has been a really complicated road to getting here. At this moment I am all alone in a remote place away from everyone to force me to be alone with my self.\
It's a place where I hadn't been alone for the past 7 years. I always came here with family. Particularly the past 5 years when I had a relationship with my ex.\
\
It's strange being here alone. It's a place I know very well and had always felt comfortable here but I admit that I miss having that wonderful smile, laugh and amazing energy of my ex around me.\
\
This forces me to remind myself that THIS PATH IS ABOUT ME, not about my ex, not about our relationship or even about a future relationship.\
It's to build me to the person I want to be.\
\
I have been here for 12 hours and before coming here I planed some activities and projects to fill my time. Some are pleasure, some are projects to make me start and achieve something. It's all part of my mental process.\
\
Nonetheless this process of being with myself is only starting at this point. I am forced to take care of myself, there's no one else around to help so taking care of myself it the only option.\
\
So the first 12 hours have been an emotional roller coaster. The whole trip, being brought back memories from amazing past times during the last 5 years. I have accepted those were amazing times that I will always cherish and gratefully remember them.\
It has also brought me back that feeling where I honestly miss having her around.\
\
For the rest of today I have planned a trip, alone, to places I wanted to visit around here but never had the opportunity to visit. So instead of waiting for someone to be available to do something I want to do, let's go.
