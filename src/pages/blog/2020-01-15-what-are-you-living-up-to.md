  As we grow to become adults we tend to forget and, sometimes, ignore how we
  are living our lives. We simply go along with the ride and see where life
  takes us. Is this the right path to the fulfilled life you want?

When we were kids we used to pretend we were a cartoon character we looked up to. One of my favorites was, and still is, Captain America.

I still have memories of that time when I used to pick up a blue teddy bear that had suspenders and use it as a shield and go around showing off my strength to protect my friends from evildoers.

When I think about it I see in myself many of Captain America values such as perseverance, courage, and humility.

But as I grew up I stopped playing and stopped looking at Captain America as a reference in my life. Society did a great job to instill values from the people and environment around me but were those values the right values for person I wanted to become?

All this is an important part of the process to define our personality and the person we will become further along the way but what if we had positive role models to guide us on our growth path?

I know some people who are fortunate to have those role models since a very young age. They are today, successful people within their own terms. Others, a group I am part of, were allowed to let life decide the path for us. We didn't do much to decide where life took us. We simply chose between the options presented, the one we found a better fit according to what we wanted. But was this the best option we could have?

What if, instead of going to a school to learn a subject you enjoy, you had the chance to learn directly from the most successful people in that area? Would you prefer to go to school or learn from with and from them?

It's important to be conscious that we need to have something to live up to. Something we desire so much that we can base decisions on if that will happen or not, because in the end, if we want it that much, we will always feel something is missing until we get it.

In my personal case, right now I am focused on creating a life I am honestly and truly proud of and becoming the Hero of my personal story. I am at this moment because I did not make choices to have in my life what I needed to myself but instead sacrificed my needs for someone else.

I honestly hope that in the future, my life story will inspire other people to work on becoming the hero of their own story like I am working on becoming the hero of my own.
